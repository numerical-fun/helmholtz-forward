Revisions in Version 1.2
------------------------

fanbeamtomo and paralleltomo now return the correct d.

rzr allows b with multiple columns.

All iterative methods now include box constraint.

All ART methods now include a damping factor to avoid division by
very small norms.

All SIRT methods had some of the stopping rules changed:
 - DP now always uses the standard residual vector r^k = b - A x^k,
 - ME now always uses 0.5 r^k'(r^{k+1}+r^k)/||r^k||_2.

The default value for lambda was changed to 1 in kaczmarz and
symkaczmarz.

The default value for lambda was changed to 1.9/norm(A'*M*A) in
all SIRT methods.

New functions:
 - cart            - columnwise version of Kaczmarz's method,
 - phantomgallery  - collection of 2D phantoms,
 - seismicwavetomo - similar to seismictomo but without ray model.

Note: for all ART methods NCP is implemented correct but it is not
recommended as it often leads to a very early termination. CART with
a random choice of columns converges very slowly and is not included.
